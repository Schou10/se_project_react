# Weather App

This project tested my skills of understanding the new React concepts that I learned from TripleTen! I had a lot of fun and I thought it was so much fun being able to easily custamize the Application using different children. Implement Javascript and HTML in one document made my understanding of Software development grow farther than what I already new.
